# COMP20 Portfolio
 
 1. The purpose of this Git repository is to showcase my work from COMP20.
 2. My favorite assignment was assignment 4, as it allowed me to explore various topics in security.
 3. The most important thing I learned in this course was that I have the ability the explore topics on my own. This is apparent in my ability to complete assignments that often had an open-ended nature. Another example of this is the completion of my final group project where I used APIs that were not taught in the course. 
 4. Now that I have finished the course, I would like to delve deeper into the topic of security.
